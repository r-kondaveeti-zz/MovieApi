# MovieApi

Services in the project would interact with Transmission RPC, third-party APIs, and scrapes movies from multiple torrent sites. 

Users can interact with the services using UIMovieAPI react application, and can initiate, and stop the downloads. 

The API can be integrate with Plex Server so that Plex server would refresh the libraries as soon as the movie downloads.
